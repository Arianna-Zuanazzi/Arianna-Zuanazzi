## About me 👋

- 👩‍🎓 Hi, I’m @Arianna-Zuanazzi. I did my Bachelors in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Padova, and now I am a Masters student of Life Science Informatics at the University of Bonn.
- 🏫 My experience includes a summer school at the University of Southern Denmark on Artificial Intelligence for Healthcare Data, as well as a 3 months-long Bachelor thesis internship at the Digital Science Center at the University of Innsbruck working on benchmarking data integration techniques on scRNA-seq breast cancer data.
- 💼 I’ve also worked as a student assistant in neurological research, doing QC of neuroimaging segmentation while familiarising myself with both neuroanatomy and segmentation algorithms with mentoring. I am currently a research assistant in opthalmology, implementing workflow automation and analysing health data analysis using Python and R.  
- 👀 Career-wise I'm interested in bioinformatics, health analytics, medical data science and medical database management, but I have an interest in anything involving the use of CS-based methods in the physical sciences.
- 💻 My technical skills cover the Python, R and MATLAB programming languages, as well as SQL. During my studies I have been gaining experience with biomedical signal processing, machine learning and AI, and medical image processing. 
- 🎲 In my free time I enjoy astronomy, scifi, poetry writing, cooking and singing. I also have an interest in linguistics and genetics.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to genetics, health data analytics, neuroimaging, olfaction, and astronomy.
